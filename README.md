## 🏗️ Architecture

### MLP Model Structure
```
Input Layer (16 features)
    ↓
Hidden Layer 1 (128 neurons) → ReLU → Dropout(0.3)
    ↓
Hidden Layer 2 (64 neurons) → ReLU → Dropout(0.3)
    ↓
Hidden Layer 3 (32 neurons) → ReLU → Dropout(0.3)
    ↓
Output Layer (1 neuron) → Sigmoid
```

- **Optimizer:** Adam with weight decay (L2 regularization)
- **Learning Rate Scheduler:** ReduceLROnPlateau (dynamic learning rate adjustment)
- **Loss Function:** Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
- **Weight Initialization:** Xavier/Glorot initialization

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Deep Learning:** PyTorch
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Piyu242005/neural-network-churn.git
cd neural-network-churn
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 💻 Usage

### Option 1: Jupyter Notebook (Recommended for Experimentation)

Launch Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration:

```bash
jupyter notebook mlp_churn_classifier.ipynb
```

The notebook contains:
- Data exploration and visualization
- Feature engineering process
- Model architecture details
- Training with learning curves
- Comprehensive evaluation
- Baseline comparison
- Cross-validation analysis

### Option 2: Python Scripts

#### Train the model:
```bash
python train.py
```

This will:
- Load and preprocess the data
- Train the MLP classifier
- Save the trained model as `mlp_churn_classifier.pth`
- Generate training curves

#### Evaluate the model:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```

This will:
- Load the trained model
- Generate comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Create visualization plots (confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc.)

### Using the Trained Model

```python
import torch
from model import MLPClassifier

# Load trained model
checkpoint = torch.load('mlp_churn_classifier.pth')
model = MLPClassifier(input_dim=16, hidden_dims=[128, 64, 32], dropout_rate=0.3)
model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])
model.eval()

# Make predictions
with torch.no_grad():
    predictions = model(new_data)
```

## 📈 Feature Engineering

The dataset is transactional, so churn labels were engineered from customer behavior:

### Engineered Features

**Numerical Features:**
- Total orders
- Total revenue, average revenue, revenue std
- Total profit, average profit
- Average discount rate
- Total quantity, average quantity
- Days since last purchase
- Customer lifetime (days)
- Purchase frequency

**Categorical Features (encoded):**
- Region
- Product category
- Customer segment  
- Payment method

### Churn Definition

A customer is classified as **churned** if:
- No purchase in the last **90 days**, OR
- Total profit in the **bottom 30%**, OR
- Fewer than **3 orders** AND no activity in **60 days**

## 🎓 Model Training Details

### Hyperparameters

```python
BATCH_SIZE = 32
EPOCHS = 100
LEARNING_RATE = 0.001
DROPOUT_RATE = 0.3
HIDDEN_DIMS = [128, 64, 32]
WEIGHT_DECAY = 1e-5
EARLY_STOPPING_PATIENCE = 15
```

### Training Features

- **Early Stopping:** Prevents overfitting by stopping when validation loss plateaus
- **Learning Rate Scheduling:** ReduceLROnPlateau reduces LR by 50% after 5 epochs of no improvement
- **Cross-Validation:** 5-fold CV to ensure robust generalization
- **Batch Training:** Mini-batch gradient descent with batch size 32

## 📊 Results & Visualizations

### Training Curves
![Training Curves](training_curves.png)

### Confusion Matrix
Shows the model's prediction accuracy across both classes (Active vs Churned customers).

### ROC Curve
Demonstrates excellent discriminative ability with AUC = 0.92.

### Feature Importance
Analysis reveals which features contribute most to churn predictions.

## 🔍 Key Insights

1. **Days since last purchase** is the strongest predictor of churn
2. **Total profit** and **purchase frequency** are also highly predictive
3. The MLP captures complex non-linear relationships better than logistic regression
4. Dropout regularization significantly improves generalization
5. Learning rate scheduling stabilizes training and improves convergence
